Dota2 Wiki Scraper API

This is a Python-based scraper that extracts information from the Dota2 Wiki (https://dota2.fandom.com/) and turns it into an API. The scraper is capable of extracting hero counters, good/bad hero matchups, and hero combinations that work well together. The API can be accessed using HTTP requests and can be used for data analysis and visualization, as well as for creating Dota2 related applications.

The scraper uses BeautifulSoup and Requests libraries to parse the webpages and extract relevant information, and then converts the data into JSON format. The API is created using Flask, a lightweight web framework for Python. The API provides endpoints for accessing the information extracted by the scraper.

This project is perfect for anyone interested in Dota2 data analysis or for those looking to create Dota2 applications.
