Dota2 Wiki Scraper API

This is a Python-based scraper that extracts information from the Dota2 Wiki (https://dota2.fandom.com/). The scraper is capable of extracting hero counters, good/bad hero matchups, and hero combinations that work well together.
The scraper uses BeautifulSoup and Requests libraries to parse the webpages and extract relevant information, and then converts the data into JSON format.

This project is perfect for anyone interested in Dota2 data analysis or for those looking to create Dota2 applications.
